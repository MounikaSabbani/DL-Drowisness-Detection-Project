### DL-Drowisness-Detection-Project

Dataset is available http://vlm1.uta.edu/~athitsos/projects/drowsiness/ to download (difficult to upload
on GitHub and even hard to send as zip folder)

But Uploading csv files of extracted features from frames which are generated from video for executing
code. This is used to check the performance of LSTM.
We also have created our own dataset of images from two different sources that we are uploading as a
zip folder. This dataset is specially designed for Mobilenet and Alexnet models.
